# Uber Eats Feature Launch: Smart Dish Discovery

---

## Overview
Picking what to eat can be overwhelming. Even after searching for something like "steak" or "ramen," users are flooded with choices, making it hard to find the best options.

This project introduces **Smart Dish Discovery** — an AI-powered Uber Eats feature that shows users the most loved, most ordered dishes trending near them based on real-time data.

The goal: **help users decide faster, discover better, and trust their choices.**

---

## Problem
- Too many choices lead to decision fatigue.
- No clear way to see trending dishes based on live data.
- Users default to fast food and miss out on trending, high-quality local meals.

---

## Solution: Smart Dish Discovery
- When a user searches (e.g., "Steak"), Uber Eats ranks dishes by:
  - Real-time order counts
  - Average star ratings
  - Delivery speed
  - Personal taste preferences (learned over time)
- Trending dishes are shown first, making it easy to trust and choose.

2. Tap search bar, type a dish like "Steak."
3. See a dynamic list of trending steaks nearby.

## Tools and Data Used

### Tools
- **Figma** – For designing the mobile screen mockups (search screen, dish detail, notifications)
- **Canva** – For creating presentation-style visuals and polishing UX flows
- **Python (Matplotlib, NetworkX)** – For building the pie chart, bar chart, and system architecture diagram
- **Google Sheets** – To simulate sample order volume data (for trend analysis charts)

### Data Sources
- **Simulated Order Data** – Created sample restaurant orders (e.g., 310 Ribeye Steak orders, 210 Sirloin orders) to build trending charts
- **Uber Eats Public App Reviews** – Reviewed real user feedback from the App Store to understand frustration points around search and discovery
- **Personal Food Delivery Experience** – Used real-world user behavior insights on decision-making while ordering food online

## Final Thoughts
Smart Dish Discovery transforms Uber Eats from a food delivery app into a **trusted foodie guide** — showing users exactly what's trending, popular, and loved right now.

It helps users order faster, feel better about their choices, and discover amazing meals nearby.
