# Uber Eats Feature Launch: Smart Dish Discovery

---

## 🚀 Overview
Picking what to eat can be overwhelming. Even after searching for something like "steak" or "ramen," users are flooded with choices, making it hard to find the best options.

This project introduces **Smart Dish Discovery** — an AI-powered Uber Eats feature that shows users the most loved, most ordered dishes trending near them based on real-time data.

The goal: **help users decide faster, discover better, and trust their choices.**

---

## 🔥 Problem
- Too many choices lead to decision fatigue.
- No clear way to see trending dishes based on live data.
- Users default to fast food and miss out on trending, high-quality local meals.

---

## 🛠️ Solution: Smart Dish Discovery
- When a user searches (e.g., "Steak"), Uber Eats ranks dishes by:
  - Real-time order counts
  - Average star ratings
  - Delivery speed
  - Personal taste preferences (learned over time)
- Trending dishes are shown first, making it easy to trust and choose.
